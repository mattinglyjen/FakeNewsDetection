Project Proposal: Machine Learning to Find Fake News

The objective of our project is to use machine learning to determine whether a given article is fake or real news. We will create a web-based user interface in which a user can type in some text and the algorithm will predict whether the news is fake or real. Ideally, companies, governments, and other entities can use this type of process to determine the likelihood of whether a news article that is being spread by social media or other means is fake or is true.

Proposed Data Analysis Process:<br>

•    Use Python to import the dataset.<br>
•    Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the dataset.<br>
•    Perform data cleaning such as removing stop words.<br>
•    Perform tokenizing for the model.<br>
•    Build and train the model.<br>
•    Assess the performance of the model.<br>
•    Save the model.<br>
•    Deploy the app to the web.<br>

Tools/ libraries:<br>

Python/ Pandas<br>
Python Matplotlib<br>
Scikit-Learn/other machine learning libraries<br>
SQL (pgAdmin)<br>
Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>
